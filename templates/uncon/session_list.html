        <p>TransparencyCamp is an "unconference", which means that participants set the agenda, lead sessions, and drive the dialogue. Most of the schedule will be set during the event itself, so, when you attend, be sure to bring along some ideas for what youâ€™d like to talk about! To kick things off, we've opened up <a href="http://goo.gl/mod/XA86">this forum</a> for you to brainstorm sessions and topics you would like to lead, co-lead, or just see discussed. We'll select the most popular session ideas to fill our first round of sessions on Day One of the Camp. Check back to see what others want to talk about and to add your own thoughts, too!</p>
        <p>To get a sense of what sessions and agenda from last year, check out the <b>TransparencyCamp 2011</b> schedule listed below.</p>
