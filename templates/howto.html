    TransparencyCamp is the Sunlight Foundation's largest and most popular
    community event. Its purpose is to both bridge the broad range of
    communities passionate about government transparency, accountability and
    technology in the present and to help create the policies, ideas, and
    technologies that will define the field's future.
    </em></p>
    <p><em>
    Whether you’re interested in hosting your own version of
    TransparencyCamp, creating a derivative, but related event, or are just
    scoping out new approaches to “unconference” organizing, this guide is
    for you. The first section offers an introduction to TransparencyCamp,
    it's history and foundations. The second goes into details on organizing
    an open space or unconference event and is intended to help first-time

    <h3 id="tcamp_history">I. Introduction: The History of TransparencyCamp</h3>
    <p>
    Since its founding in 2006, Sunlight Foundation -- a nonpartisan, nonprofit
    based in Washington, DC, working to increase government transparency through
    technology -- has served as a bridge between groups interested in greater
    government openness and accountability. Our work and the communities that we
    work with extends from bloggers and technologists to journalists, government
    officials and nonprofits. While we&rsquo;ve benefited from breaking the
    barriers that sometimes separate these groups, in 2009 we started wondering
    if there was a way to help these communities connect on their own, but
    within the context of our shared goal for greater transparency in government.
    </p>
    <p>
    For inspiration, we turned to Foo Camp, an annual meeting hosted by O&rsquo;Reilly
    Media. Foo Camp was structured in a unique model called an &ldquo;
    unconference&rdquo; -- a style of event where the participants set the
    agenda themselves. At Foo Camp, this model proved an interesting way to
    generate new ideas in technology and to promote cross-pollination between
    different specialists and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sunlight wondered what ideas could be generated for technology and &nbsp;
    policy in this context. So, in 2009, we started an experiment:
    TransparencyCamp. The first Camp was held over two at George Washington
    University and drew around 100 participants who convened to discuss the
    challenges involved in creating and implementing transparency policies in
    the US government. These conversations led to our second Camp later that
    same year, &ldquo;TransparencyCamp West,&rdquo; co-hosted by Google in
    Mountain View, California.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2010, TransparencyCamp returned back to DC and has since then grown
    dramatically in scope, scale, and concept: TransparencyCamp 2011 nearly
    doubled the size of its predecessors, bringing together over 270 attendees
    from a much wider professional background. It also marked the start of two
    important programs: the TransparencyCamp Scholarship program, which helps
    mostly US-based attendees defer travel costs to attend Camp, and the
    TransparencyCamp international program, which supports individuals from
    across the globe to attend both TransparencyCamp and a series of pre-Camp
    discussions. Our fifth and latest Camp, &ldquo;TCamp&rdquo; 2012, built upon
    these foundations, strengthening the inclusion of local and international
    topics in the conversation, and drawing out new and younger voices. It also
    set some records: over 400 people from 27 countries and 26 states came to DC
    for TCamp 2012 -- an impressive reflection of how the culture of
    transparency is growing, affecting multiple levels of government all over
    the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    TransparencyCamp has helped inspire some big name projects, from US-based
    organizations like Code for America, CityCamp and CrisisCommons to the Brazil
    -based Transpar&ecirc;ncia Hacker. But some of its greatest achievements
    occur at the individual level: Attendees leave TransparencyCamp with new
    insight into their work, concrete plans to improve their communities, and
    new connections that strengthen the network of people working for greater
    government transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;TCamp&rdquo; has also inspired similar events worldwide: Former
    attendees and others began to express an interest in utilizing the
    TransparencyCamp model outside of DC, with Camps appearing in Warsaw (
    TransparencyCamp Poland, 2010) and Vilnius (TransparencyWorks Lithuania, 2011
    ). In 2012, Sunlight formalized its commitment to international work and
    included support for TransparencyCamps as a key part of its platform.
    </p>
    <p>
    The TransparencyCamp model is extremely adaptable, capable of functioning
    for small groups and large crowds. We are committed to making it easier for
    others to adapt and create derivatives from the version of the unconference
    model that fuels TransparencyCamp, and to that end, we offer this overview
    and guide. Contained within you&rsquo;ll find the the foundational strategy
    and rationale that has fueled TransparencyCamp for the last four years, and
    we look forward to seeing this model used as a springboard to social change.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tcamp_foundations">II. TransparencyCamp Foundations</h3>
    <p>Or, What makes TransparencyCamp TransparencyCamp?</p>
    <p>
    Although the DC-area TransparencyCamp has grown in its scope, organization,
    and mission over time, there are three essential qualities that pervade each
    and every TCamp and distinguish it from other events in the field. For a
    TransparencyCamp to be a TransparencyCamp, it must be built on this framework.
    </p>
    <p>
    In no particular order:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Agenda</li>
        <li>Multidisciplinary Audience</li>
        <li>Transparency Theme</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="open_agenda">1. Open Agenda</h3>
    <p>
    TransparencyCamp is a variation on participant-led events called &ldquo;
    unconferences.&rdquo; At these events, attendees set the agenda for what
    will be discussed by suggesting session topics within a greater theme (in
    this case, government transparency). The role of the event organizer is to
    provide structure for these sessions, to facilitate ways for attendees to
    meet one another, and create opportunities for conversation and community-
    building. Although this usually includes introductory and concluding
    sessions that gather all the attendees together, the organizers do not
    dictate the majority content of the event. Thus, the agenda is &ldquo;open&rdquo;
    because the participants provide leadership and input as to the
    content.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not all TransparencyCamps need the same degree of participant-driven
    organization, however, to be considered a TransparencyCamp, the agenda must
    welcome participant input to some degree.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, at the DC-based TCamp, the open agenda is translated into a
    multi-step process: (1) Attendees are given an online platform to suggest
    sessions in advance of the conference, (2) within the same platform,
    attendees vote on which of these session ideas will be placed in the first
    time block of the event; then (3) on the first day of the event, once
    attendees have gathered in person, they have time after the introductory
    gathering to contribute more sessions and workshops to The Wall (the schedule)
    at the start of each day. Although this process allows attendees to
    contribute almost all of the content for Camp (leaving aside introductory
    talks and the conclusion session), it also reserves the actual placement of
    sessions into particular time slots as a task to be done by the
    TransparencyCamp organizing team. In other words, the DC-based TCamp has an
    open agenda in that the substance is determined by attendees even though the
    structure is determined by the organizers.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are plenty of variations on this model and, depending on the size of
    your event, you may opt for more participant leadership (such as asking
    attendees to volunteer on-site to be the people who set The Wall) or less (
    such as requiring more online pre-determination of sessions, utilizing
    participant input).
    </p>
    <p>
    In any scenario, some measure of an open agenda is critical to the success
    of your event. It is through this structure that you communicate the kind of
    culture and conversation you want to derive during Camp. Engaging
    participants in the process of setting the agenda is a clear, if somewhat
    unusual way of communicating to your attendees that the event will truly
    only work if they speak up and participate, that the greatest insights and
    most efficient and creative problem-solving will come from interpersonal
    collaboration, and that the challenges or projects identified by
    participants aren&rsquo;t remote issues that only experts can tackle, but
    are tangible puzzles within the power of each attendee to help solve.
    </p>

    <h3 id="multidisciplinary_audience">2. Multidisciplinary Audience</h3>
    <p>
    Most conferences draw from a singular professional field or interest group.
    Although TransparencyCamp is organized to bring together people interested
    in government transparency, the goal is to cut across communities. Thus,
    successful TransparencyCamps should bring together at least two to three (if
    not all) of the following: journalists, advocates, developers,
    technologists, policy-makers, government officials, students, academics,
    nonprofit workers and the public at large.
    </p>
    <p>
    TransparencyCamp&rsquo;s emphasis on open agendas and attendee participation
    rests on the idea that the people in the room will rely on their experiences
    and knowledge to contribute to shaping the Camp and influencing the results.
    By making sure that these participants come from a variety of professional
    backgrounds, you increase the range of experiences and expertise at the
    event, something that will likely impact the depth of conversations and the
    range of the next steps that can be taken afterwards. For example, TCamp
    sessions about releasing government information online are often driven by
    government officials, journalists, and/or issue advocates. While it&rsquo;s
    fantastic to get these actors to talk to each other, making it easy for a
    technologist or developer to join that dialogue can be extremely helpful:
    Not only do these technology experts play a role in helping to measure what&
    rsquo;s possible (when it comes to technical solutions), but they can also
    highlight loopholes in existing policies and provide new contacts for
    potential projects or future collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Concern about the difficulty of reaching certain communities can be offset
    by making the registration process open to anyone and by planning for a long
    period of pre-event outreach to specific stakeholder groups to ensure their
    participation.
    </p>

    <h3 id="transparency_theme">3. Transparency Theme</h3>
    <p>
    Outside of structural similarities, the unifying thread between Camps is the
    emphasis on government transparency. How broadly or narrowly that&rsquo;s
    interpreted is up to the organizer. It is expected that every
    TransparencyCamp will be slightly unique because of its open agenda,
    multidisciplinary audience, and the political context in which it&rsquo;s
    held. Government transparency issues vary from region to region and country
    to country. TransparencyCamp can and should reflect that.
    </p>
    <p>
    To this point, it is not essential that a Camp organized on the foundations
    of TransparencyCamp hold the title &ldquo;TransparencyCamp.&rdquo; The
    cultural context of the event, as well as the aims and substance, should
    direct what the event is ultimately called. There is no need to hold strict
    adherence to TransparencyCamp name or lingo.

    <h3>Lessons Learned from TransparencyCamp</h3>

    <p><em>
    Welcome to the Sunlight Foundation’s guide to unconference organizing.
    This guide builds upon our experience running TransparencyCamps and
    draws from broader traditions of unconference and event organizing,
    intended to help first-time unconference organizers and veterans alike.
    Although unconferences encourage innovation and adaptation on their
    format, there are some basic concepts that we've found helpful in
    creating a productive, welcoming unconference that we’ve included here.
    </em></p>
    <p><em>
    The first section covers general resources for unconference
    administration. The second dives into deeper detail about session
    structure and shares tips and additional resources for running the event
    and conducting outreach.

    <h3 id="resources_for_organizers">I. Resources for Organizers</h3>
    <h4 id="organizing_todo_list">1. ORGANIZING TO-DO LIST</h4>
    <p><strong>STAGE 1: Foundational logistics</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine budget</li>
        <li>Set goal number of attendees</li>
        <li>Determine date</li>
        <li>Reserve venue**</li>
        <li>Find partnerships/sponsorships</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>STAGE 2: Outreach</strong><br/>
        Ideally: Start this stage at least 3 months before your event.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Establish web presence</li>
        <li>Announce a &ldquo;Save the Date!&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Open online registration</li>
        <li>Invite participants and promote event</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>STAGE 3: Program Details and Logistics</strong><br/>
        Ideally: Start this stage at least 2 months before your event.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Evaluate any additional programming (hackathons, etc.)</li>
        <li>Set schedule structure</li>
        <li>If applicable, invite speakers</li>
        <li>Finalize catering and food</li>
        <li>Finalize any swag/giveaways</li>
        <li>Plan your day-of logistics</li>
    </ol>
    <p><Strong>Notes:</Strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Most Camps can easily be organized within three months, though it&rsquo;s
            recommended that if you&rsquo;re aiming for a large event (over 100 people),
            you should give yourself additional time.
        </li>
        <li>
            **Because the participants direct so much of the unconference, prioritize
            securing the date, time and venue for your Camp. Everything else can follow
            from there.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="leadership_structure">2. LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE</h4>
    <p><strong>CORE ORGANIZING TEAM</strong></p>
    <p>
    The leadership structure for the administration of an unconference begins
    with one person (the &ldquo;Lead Organizer&rdquo;) charged with keeping of
    track of the event&rsquo;s progress and delegating core responsibilities to
    an &ldquo;organizing team.&rdquo; The Lead Organizer should be engaged in
    the process of pulling together the event, but should still empower other
    members of the team to manage core responsibilities.
    Depending on what roles the individuals in this core team take on, you may
    even want to distinguish them as point people by using titles such as &ldquo;
    Captain&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
    How you breakout responsibilities among your core team will vary according
    to your needs, core team size and the scale of your event.
    </p>
    <p>
    To identify what other core responsibilities might exist, we&rsquo;ve broken
    down responsibilities by broad topics below and listed particular activities
    within each topic. The average sized Camp will likely need just one Captain
    for each top-level responsibility (i.e. &ldquo;Logistics Captain&rdquo;),
    but large Camps can benefit from assigning leads to individual activities (i.e
    &ldquo;Food Captain&rdquo;, &ldquo;Volunteer Captain,&rdquo; etc.). Each
    Captain can be assigned event staff and volunteers (discussed below) as
    needed.

    <p><strong>Event Staff</strong></p>
    <p>
    Event staff are volunteers who work with the organizing team to help keep
    the event running smoothly. These staff should answer to Captains/Leads and
    are generally only needed for the day-of the event. How many volunteers fall
    into each category will entirely depend on the scale of your Camp. What
    follows are descriptions of possible event staff positions and tips on
    recruitment:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
            <strong>Possible Event Staff Positions</strong>:
            These are some common responsibilities for volunteers. It is not an
            inclusive list nor are all the responsibilities listed necessarily a fit for
            your event. What responsibilities you&rsquo;ll need staff to cover and how
            these positions are assigned is ultimately up to the Lead Organizer and the
            Captains.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration</strong>: Sign in attendees and distribute nametags</li>
                <li><strong>Donation Management</strong>: Manage any t-shirts and/or
                    giveaways and collect donations, if relevant
                </li>
                <li><strong>General Information</strong>: General resource for attendees</li>
                <li><strong>Time Keepers</strong>: Give notice to session leaders
                    when sessions are about to end. (Ideally sent out 5 minutes before
                    the session ends and then at the final end of session)
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Wall</strong>: Manage attendee questions, placement
                    of session cards, etc.
                </li>

            <strong>Recruitment</strong>
            Event staff can be drawn from anywhere, from partner organizations
            supporting your event to ambitious friends. If you find yourself
            needing more people to help, look towards recruiting students
            from college and university or offering free or discounted tickets
            to attendees in exchange for their help.

    <h3 id="glossary_and_tips">II. Elements of an Unconference</h3>
    <h4 id="sessions">1. SESSIONS</h4>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Sessions&rdquo; are the workshops, talks and discussion groups that
    make up the conference. The order and room assignment for sessions is
    assigned through The Wall (explained below). Sessions are usually led by
    participants, although you can also open up the opportunity to lead to event
    staff as well.
    </p>
    <p><strong>TIME:</strong>
        The average time slot given to TransparencyCamp sessions in DC is about 50
        minutes to an hour. Opting for 50
        minutes allows for participants to have enough time to move from one session
        room to another and prevents sessions that go long from messing up the rest
        of the schedule. For technical classes or training, planning or allowing for
        some longer sessions might be useful.
    </p>
    <p><strong>FORMAT:</strong>
        Unconference sessions place an emphasis on informal dialogue and
        conversation above pre-designed presentations. Although participants are
        allowed to bring slides and come with a presentations in mind, the goal is
        to move beyond a lecture format into discussion. Saying this explicitly
        during the introductory session can help set expectations and empower
        attendees to participate more throughout the event.
    </p>
    <p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT:</strong>
        Generally, sessions are about...</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Subjects the participant is an expert on and wants to discuss further</li>
        <li>Subjects the participant is a novice on and wants to learn more about</li>
        <li>Projects participants are working on and want to share and discuss</li>
        <li>Issues that have no clear solution that the participant wants to address</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Although there are many more general categories of sessions, each of those
        listed above includes a common theme at the core of TransparencyCamp:
        Discussion. Although, as mentioned above, sessions may take different shapes
        (e.g. workshops) and can include pre-made presentations, the best
        unconference sessions are those that foster and rely on informal dialogue
        between the session leaders and the participants.
    </p>
    <h4 id="the_wall">2. THE WALL</h4>
    <p>
        The Wall is the schedule for the unconference.
        Often, The Wall is &ldquo;built&rdquo; on physical wall space using paper or
        index cards and is laid out in a tabular format. As you&rsquo;ll note in the
        pictures on the next page, the columns on the table mark the rooms and
        spaces where sessions will be held and the rows mark the blocks of time
        during which sessions will occur. Filling in the middle are the session
        titles, listed on separate sheets of paper, where attendees have written the
        name of their session, along with their names and contact information (
        email, cell, Twitter handle or whatever&rsquo;s most relevant).
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>HOW TO SET THE WALL:</strong>
        Generally, the structure for The Wall (which includes the headings for the
        room names and the outline of time blocks) is set up before attendees arrive
        for the event, but &ldquo;building The Wall&rdquo; -- that is, adding the
        sessions to the schedule structure -- is left for the attendees to
        contribute to. One way to deal with building The Wall is to set aside
        specific time to do so. For example, at TransparencyCamp in DC, we set aside
        a half hour after the introductory session for Wall building. During this
        period, we let attendees submit the titles of their talks, along with their
        names and contact information, to volunteers stationed at The Wall. Those
        participants that don&rsquo;t want to lead a session can grab coffee and
        congregate during this time. The reason why we wait until after the
        introductory session to do this is because we use part of our introduction
        to Camp explain The Wall and expectations for participation before the event
        gets underway.
    </p>
    <p>
        Materials for setting and building The Wall can range from paper and tape to
        whiteboard and pens. There are no rules here, just make sure to have some
        paper set aside for the attendees to write out their ideas and think them
        through if they need to.
    </p>

    <small><strong>Picture 1:</strong>
    Although you can&rsquo;t see the listing of session blocks long the right
    side of The Wall, this picture shows what The Wall for TransparencyCamp 2012
    looked like before participants arrive. Along the top, marking each column,
    are room numbers. Each of the rows is a time block. The orange line was a
    fun element we added to mark when lunch was. The second row are the sessions
    for the first time block -- the ones that our participants voted most
    popular through an online forum before attending.</small>

    <small><strong>Picture 2:</strong>
    What The Wall on Day 2 of TransparencyCamp 2012 looked like after it was
    built. The Wall continues to stretch to the right, creating one column for
    each breakout room. Although, traditionally, the session cards are
    handwritten by participants, we opted to type up the handwritten forms
    attendees gave us to avoid problems with legibility.</small>
    </p>

    <img height="293" src="http://assets.transparencycamp.org.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0/images/tcamp_howto_3.jpeg" width="391"><br/>
    <small><strong>Picture 3:</strong>
    The Wall from TransparencyCamp 2010. This Wall has a similar set-up (room
    numbers as columns, time blocks as rows) but uses the original cards
    handwritten by participants to fill in the table.</small>
    </p>
    <p><strong>STRATEGIES FOR MANAGEMENT:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Pre-scheduling</strong>:
        It can be difficult to set The Wall quickly, so to best manage time,
        TransparencyCamp DC uses participant input to pre-schedule the first
        time-block (see Picture 1). To do this, we utilize a web platform
        that allows participants to share their session ideas publicly.
        Then, other participants vote on the sessions they like the best.
        The sessions with the most votes automatically fill the first time
        block. This gives the volunteers more time to build The Wall (since
        they can continue to work through the first block) and allows
        participants to jump right into the event without waiting too long.
        Note that this kind of pre-scheduling still involves participant
        leadership and direction. (You can learn more about the online
        platforms we used in Section 6: Online Engagement.)
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Dealing with similar session topics</strong>:
        Often, participants will suggest sessions with similar titles or aims.
        Rather than filling up the schedule with these sessions, check in
        with these participants (using the contact information they
        submitted with their session card) and ask if they’d be comfortable
        co-leading with each other. If so, treat their separate session
        ideas as one.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Set one Wall per day</strong>: If you’re running a
        multi-day event, try building the schedule one day at a time.
        This allows people who can only attend one day to participate
        more and gives attendees time to reflect on their experiences
        from Day 1 to craft content for Day 2. At TransparencyCamp DC,
        we often let people give us session cards for Day 2 in advance,
        even if we’re waiting to build that Wall.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Only let your volunteers touch The Wall</strong>:
        Depending on the size of your event, managing the placement of
        sessions into the schedule as well as the variety of needs of
        participants can get overwhelming. To address this, it can be
        helpful to have a pre-trained Wall Team of one to three
        volunteers who can answer questions, help attendees fill out
        their session cards, and who place the sessions on The Wall.
        Although attendees can of course request time slots for their
        session, having the volunteers be the ones to place the actual
        session cards prevents people from changing the schedule after
        it’s been set and ensures equal treatment among attendees. This
        practice, like all listed here, is not a requirement, but a
        recommendation.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="norms">3. UNCONFERENCE NORMS</h4>
    <p>
    In the introduction session, it can be useful to make the norms (&ldquo;rules&rdquo;)
    and expectations of the unconference explicit. A few important
    norms to note:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The freedom to move:</strong>
            Participants are free to sit in on multiple sessions, leave these sessions
            as they see fit, and opt to be out of session. All session attendance is
            voluntary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Participation means contributing and listening:</strong>
            Although participants should be encouraged to take advantage of the
            conversational structure to be assertive and speak their minds, everyone
            &rsquo;s experience is better if people listen, too.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Everyone has something to share:</strong>
            Sessions can and should be lead by novices and experts alike. Encouraging
            your attendees to lead a session not just as a way to share what they know,
            but as a way to ask questions and learn from others can be a great way to
            get unique, valuable session topics suggested.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, it&rsquo;s a bit of an unconference tradition to find a way in the
            introductory session to allow all attendees to introduce themselves to each
            other. Often, this is done through games or &ldquo;three word introductions,&rdquo;
            a quick round of introductions where everyone in the opening session (
            including event staff and organizers) stands up, speaks their name, and
            lists three words that describe their interests (e.g. &ldquo;parliament&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;XML&rdquo;, &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;). The goal is to give attendees some
            sense of community with people around them, while also making it easier for
            conversations to start later.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="tickets">4. TICKETS</h4>
    <p>
        Since unconferences seek to create a low barriers to participation, the cost
        for attendance is generally kept very low. TransparencyCamp DC has opted to
        charge around $20 to $30, offering discounts to students, volunteers and
        those who simply can&rsquo;t pay. The reason why we charge anything at all
        is not really to cover costs, but rather to ensure attendance. We have found
        that offering the event as completely free means that people will sign-up
        but feel no need to actually attend. What you charge will depend on your
        context and funding, but you should feel encouraged to experiment.
    </p>
    <h4 id="venue">5. VENUE</h4>
    <p>
        For the venue, look for a place where you have...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Common space</strong>
            to gather gather all your participants together (critical for the start of your event and good for the conclusion)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breakout rooms</strong>
            -- like classrooms or meeting rooms -- to hold the actual unconference
            sessions (should fid 10 - 30 people). Although you can just divide the main
            room into smaller discussion circles for the sessions, depending on your
            resources and the size of your event, separate rooms may be more comfortable
            and can help control problems with sound (such as one group being too loud).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Wifi</strong>, power outlets, and technical equipment (i.e. projectors), if you&rsquo;re
            hosting a tech-savvy audience
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bonus space</strong>, while not necessary, having room to freely follow-up and
            brainstorm with fellow attendees can be an asset
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="online_engagement">6. ONLINE ENGAGEMENT</h4>
    <p>
    Unconferences don&rsquo;t need to have an online component, but some benefit
    greatly from opening the door to participation through social media and email.
    Should you be interested in utilizing online engagement, here are a few
    ideas worth exploring:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Create an Event Website</strong>
        The DC-based TransparencyCamp and its website are published under a
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative
        Commons Attribution, Share-alike License</a>.
        Please feel free to pull material, web design, and related resources
        from <a href="http://transparencycamp.org">http://transparencycamp.org</a>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Make Communal Note-taking and Record-keeping Easy</strong>
        It’s useful to provide attendees with a space to share their notes
        for both those attendees engaging in a session and for those who
        could not attend, but would like to learn more about the
        conversation there. Traditionally, <strong>wikis</strong> have been an easy platform
        for this kind of record-keeping, although shared text editors, like
        <strong>Etherpad</strong> or <strong>Hackpad</strong>, are also good options. Links to these communal
        resources should be on your Camp’s website and participants should
        be encouraged to use them during the introduction to the conference.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Have a Social Media Presence</strong>
        Social media can provide a great space for side conversations and
        collective dialogue among participants. If your community uses
        <strong>Twitter</strong>, be sure to create a hashtag. TransparencyCamp DC can be
        found <a href="https://twitter.com/TCampDC">@TCampDC</a> and has
        year specific hashtags for each event (e.g.
        #TCamp12 (for 2012), #TCamp11 (for 2011), etc.)
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Keep the Conversation Going Post-Camp</strong>
        <strong>Google groups, Yahoo groups, Facebook groups</strong> and other <strong>email lists</strong>
        or social media groupings can be fantastic platforms to keep your
        attendees connected to one another after your event is over. Pick
        the platform that best fits the common use and interest of your
        attendees and make sure to include a link from your website to this
        resource.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Collect Pre-Camp Session Suggestions</strong>
        For a more survey-oriented approach (which would limit public facing
        results but can be good for the organizers to collect information),
        <strong>SurveyMonkey</strong> or <strong>Google Forms</strong> are
        two free, customizable options. To allow participants to see each
        other’s suggestions and to vote and comment on these ideas, explore
        platforms like <strong>Uservoice</strong> and <strong>Google
        Moderator</strong>. Let the structure of your event determine
        whether these sort of platforms are even necessary for your Camp.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="documentation">7. DOCUMENTATION</h4>
    <p>Here are some ideas for capturing your event:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Video recording sessions</strong> (and posting online so people can watch later</li>
        <li><strong>Audio recording sessions</strong> (and posting online so people can listen later</li>
        <li><strong>Livestreaming</strong> (sharing your event online as it's happening)</li>
        <li><strong>General video/photography</strong> (capturing stills and moments with your attendees)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="additional_programming">8. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING</h4>
    <p>
    This category is lists additional kinds of content that can be added to your
    event but are not necessarily inherent components of TransparencyCamp or any
    other unconference. These should serve as inspiration for different ways to
    play with the open agenda model.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Keynote Speakers or Lightning Talks</strong>
                Just because most of the content is directed by participants doesn&rsquo;t
                mean that you can&rsquo;t include speakers. Keynote talks are speeches given
                by a notable person or an important government official and are a
                traditional option utilized by many conferences. You could also opt to
                highlight some lesser known experts or to bring into focus different
                attendees through the use of lightning talks (also called Ignite Talks or
                Pecha Kucha). These speeches are usually only about 5 minutes long and tend
                to be an upbeat way of examining one story or issue. Lightning talks are
                used at TransparencyCamp DC to show the range of expertise among participants.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Happy Hours and Extracurriculars</strong>
                A trip to a pub or restaurant after the first day of the event can be a
                great way to give participants even more unstructured time to brainstorm and
                get to know one another. These can be formally or informally arranged.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Hackathons and Side Events</strong>
                Hackathons are events geared toward allowing developers, designers, and
                other technologists to write applications and code communally. Some in the
                transparency field like to use events like TransparencyCamp to find
                developers interested in working with civic and government data, and a
                hackathon may be a good way to engage with this community. If you&rsquo;re
                interested in hosting a hackathon along with your TransparencyCamp, be aware
                that scheduling the unconference and hackathon programming during the same
                timeslots can prevent technologists from attending sessions and may lure
                them out of the unconference environment. Look instead to schedule the
                hackathon programming before or after the unconference, so that
                technologists can fully participate in each.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although TransparencyCamp can be its own stand alone event, it&rsquo;s not
                uncommon to use unconferences as part of a larger event or conference,
                serving as a platform for discussion and deliberation.
            </p>
