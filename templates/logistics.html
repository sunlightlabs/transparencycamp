        <h3>TransparencyCamp is over!</h3>
        <p>Thanks to everyone that made TransparencyCamp such a huge success. Double thanks goes to Microsoft for letting us use their amazing space!</p> 
    </div>

    <h2>Where is TransparencyCamp?</h2>

    <h3>Microsoft</h3>
    <p><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NrFg" title="Google Maps">5404 Wisconsin Avenue, Chevy Chase, MD 20815</a></p>
    
    <p>
        Microsoft’s building is literally steps away from the <a href="http://wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=11">Friendship Heights</a> metro stop -- just make sure that you exit on the Western Ave side of the metro and head up the stairs toward Wisconsin Ave., Western Ave., and Bloomingdale’s.
        There’s also parking underneath the building for $7 a day and some metered street parking.
        If you get lost, look for the folks dressed as <a href="http://transbearency.com/">bears</a> to help you (they’ll be outside the building during registration to help you find your way).
    </p>
    
    <div id="map"></div>

    <h2>When do I need to get there?</h2>
    
    <p><a href="/sessions/2/">Registration and coffee</a> will start at 9am on Saturday, April 30th. The <a href="/sessions/2/">Opening Session</a> starts at 10am -- don’t miss it!</p>
    
    <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Please help us keep TransparencyCamp as green as possible by bringing a water bottle and/or coffee mug to help keep waste down.
        Power strips and chargers for your computer, phone, etc. are also never bad ideas.
        If you’re planning to use a projector during a presentation, please bring your own <em>VGA adaptor</em>.
        Every room will have a projector, but we can’t promise we’ll have the right adaptors for your computer.
        If you need to purchase an adaptor, there is an <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2v9j">Apple Store</a> near the Bethesda Metro station and a <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/1WfY">Best Buy</a> at the Tenleytown-AU Metro station.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What should I wear?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Check the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang">Capitol Weather Gang blog</a> for the latest weather conditions.
        Dress for the Camp is casual -- just be comfortable.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Will there be internet?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes, we'll have wireless provided. Cell phone reception inside the building isn’t great, though.</p>
